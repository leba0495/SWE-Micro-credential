        <h2>Advice on Selecting a Wok to Buy</h2>
        <p>What type of wok should you buy?<br>
        There is no substitute for a good carbon steel wok. Not only is it relatively inexpensive, but it conducts heat evenly. If you are cooking with a electric hob, your best option is to use a flat bottom wok. Round bottom woks can reflect heat back on the element, damaging it. A flat-bottomed wok can also be used on gas stoves.</p>

        <p>Handle, one or two?<br>
        Originally, woks came with two metal handles. Today, flat bottom woks normally have a long wooden handle, like a skillet. The long handle makes it easy to move and tilt the wok when stir-frying. One or two, it's up to you really.</p>

        <p>Non-stick or not?<br>
        With the current interest in low-fat cooking, many manufacturers now offer woks with a non-stick coating. How well non-stick works will depend on the individual coating and how it is applied. However, in general non-stick coatings don√≠t work well on carbon steel. If you want the non-stick coating, try a heavy gauge aluminum wok, such as those made by Calphalon.</p>

        <p>Choose a Wok With a Lid<br>
        A wok with a lid will make your life a lot easier especially when you cook Chinese food. A lot of time the ingredients need to simmer and be covered during cooking.</p>

            <h2>Taking care of your wok</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Wash the wok in hot water with a small amount of liquid detergent and a scrubber.</li>
            <li>Do not use the abrasive cleanser on the inside of the wok.</li>
            <li>Rinse the wok, dry thoroughly and then place the wok on high heat.</li>
            <li>Move the wok, turning it and tilting it until the metal turns a blueish-yellowish color.</li>
            <li>Remove the wok from the heat and turn the heat down to medium-low.</li>
            <li>Add a thin film of oil over the entire inside surface of the wok with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Heat the wok on medium-low heat for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Wipe off the oil with another paper towel. There will be black residue on the towel.</li>
            <li>Repeat the oil, heat and wipe steps until no black residue comes off on the paper (about 3 times).</li>
            <li>The wok is now ready to use.</li>
        </ul>
